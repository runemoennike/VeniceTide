# VeniceTide

This is an app I made after moving to Venice (Italy), because there was no app available for Windows Phone showing tide levels and forecasts.

The app shows the current tide level as well as predictions for the next 2-3 days. The user can add locations they visit most often and the app will show if these locations are flooded or not, and if they will be flooded in the near future. It also implements a Live Tile showing forecasts and the status of selected locations.
